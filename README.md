# it-website
website for our IT class

  IT is a huge industry, with many jobs open with little trained individuals to take them. Our school has taken a step towards solving this problem by creating a brand new path of study committed to IT. This decision has opened up lots of doors to us students, and even for the school itself. 

  When our teacher informed us of a contest that could take us across the country, we were excited. Our task was to create a website for a customer and compete against other teams and individuals to earn an invitation on this trip. Luckily, our teacher gave us the perfect idea: create a website for our class. We both agreed to this project, and we set off. 

  Our website consists of information about our class, what our goals are, and projects we have done. It gives others an insight to life in our classroom and our true intentions. The community needs to learn about the IT industry and the many opportunities it could offer to students.
