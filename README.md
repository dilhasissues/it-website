# it-website
website for our IT class

  Only 40% of schools teach information technology, and 90% of parents want schools to teach it. Computer science provides more opportunities for students than any other career path in the world, and unfortunately, not many people end up in the IT industry, leaving too many jobs available for the little amount of people to fill them. Luckily, our school has taken a step towards solving this problem by creating a brand new path of study committed to IT. This decision has opened up lots of doors for us, and even for the school itself. 

  When our teacher informed us of a contest that could take us across the country, we were excited! Our task was to create a website for a customer and compete against other teams and individuals to earn an invitation on this trip. Luckily, our teacher gave us the perfect idea: create a website for IT our class. We both agreed to this project, and we set off. 

  Our website consists of information about our class, what our goals are, and projects we have done. It gives others an insight to life in our classroom and our true intentions. The community needs to learn about the IT industry and the many opportunities it could offer to students. Therefore there are outside links with career information provided.
  
  The process was long and difficult, writing code at 3 A.M., editing, and problem solving.
  
  The project was drawn on, and this is what it mainly consisted of:
